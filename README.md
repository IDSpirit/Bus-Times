# Bus-Times
I created this program so that I could see the approximate arrival times from the current time for buses in my local area. This allows me to know exactly when I should leave my house so that I am not waiting at the bus stop for too long. 

The program takes into account the day of the week as well as the times for the next day if the current time is too late, with these times being taken from the internet and posters for times at the physical bus stop. This code is also reasonably scalable as the bus times variables can be switched for any other set of times.
